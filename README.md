#CAMERA-PURGE

I'm a hobby-filmer and -photographer.

I wrote this little Tool in order to download and save the images and videos from my SD-Card.

**I like to order my files as followed:**

```bash
--Videos

----Year (eg.: 2017)

------Month (eg.: 12)

--------Day (eg.: 2017-12-16)




--Images

----Year (eg.: 2017)

------Month (eg.: 12)

--------Day (eg.: 2017-12-16)
```
